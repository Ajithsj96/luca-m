\section{Goal}

This class project boldly aims to face the challenge of the emotional state recognition in human faces through experimentation of some of the latest techniques available to develop a working prototype of an \emph{emotion detector}, \code{Emotime}.\\

\subsubsection*{Workplan (high level)}

In order to achieve this goal we have to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Set-up a image preprocessing pipeline for extracting facial ROIs and features from images.
\item Train binary classifiers
\item Build a multi-class detector using trained classifiers
\item Provide tools and GUIs for testing and using the framework
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Code Base and Other Details}

Project source code and further details are available at \url{https://github.com/luca-m/emotime/}.
